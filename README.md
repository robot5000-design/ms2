- multiple science categories.
- varying difficulties.
- a question countdown timer.
- a high score table.
- feedback as to the correct answer.

### **1. UX Design**

#### Strategy

_User Stories:_

There are 2 types of users of the site: the site owner or all other users which include students, academics etc. The 2nd group have a common set of user goals.

As the site owner:

- I want the site to be fun and appealing to use.
- I want the site to look visually appealing.
- I want the site to provoke a positive response.
- I want the site to be easy and natural to use with smooth navigation between sections.
- I want the site to not only tell the user if they got a question wrong but also to tell them the correct answer.
- I want the site to be a learning tool.
- I want users to be able to offer feedback to the site, maybe new questions.
- I want users to be able to see updates or news on the site through social media links.
- I want a countdown timer to make the quiz more exciting.
- I want sound effects to reward the user and to offer feedback.
- I want a high score table saved from session to session.
- I want to avoid repetition of questions to a user.
- I want the site to have significant interactivity.
- I want the site to deal with potential errors without breaking the site or affecting the user negatively.
- I want the functionality to be as automated as possible but I want the user to be able to move between qustions themselves so that they can take in the answers at their own pace.
